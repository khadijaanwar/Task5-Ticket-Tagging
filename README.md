# Task 5 — Auto Tagging Support Tickets with LLM

## 🎯 Objective
Automatically classify and tag **support tickets** into categories using **large language models (LLMs)**.

## 🛠️ Methodology / Approach
- Collected free-text support ticket dataset.  
- Implemented **prompt engineering** for zero-shot classification.  
- Experimented with **few-shot learning** for improved accuracy.  
- Compared performance of zero-shot vs fine-tuned models.  
- Output top-3 probable tags per ticket.  

## 📊 Key Results / Observations
- Zero-shot models performed well but missed subtle ticket categories.  
- Few-shot and fine-tuned approaches improved accuracy and consistency.  
- Multi-label prediction enhanced ticket routing efficiency.
